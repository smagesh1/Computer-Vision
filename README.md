## Image Segmentation Project
- This project focuses on developing a code that performs image segmentation, aiming to identify meaningful parts within color images. 
- Performance of the image segmentation is carried out by counting the number of true matches between this algorithm's
segmentation and the human segmentations. 
- If a boundary produced by your algorithm matches one marked by any of the human observers it counts as a true match.

## Dependencies 
- MATLAB is required to run the code.
- Can be installed from the following link:
